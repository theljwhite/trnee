# TRNEE

Allows users to create, update, and manage a customized tournament bracket. Although TRNEE is tailored to e-sports and gaming, a bracket can be generated for any hobby. A list of tournament participants can be provided at time of creation or a tournament can be joined later manually by other users. As a tournament progresses, matches can either be updated by the tournamentâ€™s participants or only its creator. In-game e-sports stats can also be attached to matches via external APIs. Users can also also view or join an existing tournament.
